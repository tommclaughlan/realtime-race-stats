  ###Race
  Details on which 'map' should be displayed in the GUI
  
  ###Team
  Which teams are participating in this race?
  
  ###Car
  The car / driver, which will include things like current speed, fuel remaining, position on track, laps completed, etc. This is the main bulk of the realtime stuff.
  
  
   _Notes: do we want to do the leaderboard logic and stuff server side? We could include this in the 'Race' topic_
